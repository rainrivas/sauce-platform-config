# sauce-platform-config
Create webdriver configs on the fly for the sauce labs platform

## Goal
Give SauceLabs users the ability to create webdriver configs at run time by using environment variables. If no configuration is passed/found, then create a random OS-Browser combo based on the available configurations found on the user's SauceLabs Grid.
